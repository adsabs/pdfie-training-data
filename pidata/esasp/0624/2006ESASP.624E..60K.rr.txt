P., Birch, A. C., Duvall, T. L., Jr., Thompson, M. J., & Zhao, J. 2006, Ap. J., 646, 543 Figure 4. Inferences for the same simulation as in Fig. 3, but using the truncated single-value decomposition (TSVD). The five columns correspond to including all the data (leftmost column), and to data with cuts at the four radii of increasing value (radius increases from left to right). The five rows correspond to different values of the trade-off parameter - trade off between resolution and error magnification - with the solution resolution increasing from bottom to top. The lower left panel is the input topology for that simulation, or the true solution. In these views, the solar surface is at the bottom of the data cube. Figure 5. Similar to Fig. 3, but for a slightly different simulation (see lower left panel, contrast near the surface.) Columns correspond to including all data or 4 different cuts

H.,, 2000,  rows correspond to different values of the trade-off parameterwith the solution resolution increasing from bottom to top. Figure 7. Inferences for the same methodology as Figs. 3 & 5 (LSQR), but using actual data (inferred values for all panels since there is no known true solution.) Figure 8. Inferences for the same methodology as Figs. 4 & 6 (TSVD), but using actual data (inferred values for all panels since there is no known true solution.) Figure 9. Resolution kernels, cut at y = 0 shown as a function of position and depth, for five depths (columns) and three trade-off values (rows). The kernels shown here correspond to a case that uses all the observables (i.e., no cut). The red symbol indicates the target location. Figure 10. Resolution kernels, cut at y = 0 shown as a function of position and depth, for one given target depth only (indicated by the red symbol). The panels show the resolution kernel for five input set cases (columns, all, and 4 cuts) and five trade-off values (rows), corresponding to the inferences shown in Figs. 4, 6 and 8. The vertical lines illustrate the radial extend of the cutouts.
