Figure 6. Comparison between synoptic maps constructed from farside calculated images (center) with the previous (top)
and following (bottom) Carrington Rotation frontside synoptic maps from magnetograms (Kitt Peak observations). The
four active regions clearly visible in the farside synoptic maps (FS5700, FS5701, FS5702 and FS5703) coincide with
large and complex active regions on the front side (NOAA-10484, 10486, 10488 and 10501). The circles for these four
regions are situated at the same location in the three maps. Two of these active regions produced the large Halloween
flares of 2003. Not all the active regions identified on the front side however are visible in the farside maps. The analysis
of particular cases will help to identify criteria in order to calibrate the farside signature as a function of magnetic
parameters.
Figure 7. Artificial data.The top panel shows the radial
component of the velocity field at the surface for a particular time. It covers 360
in longitude and 89
in latitude. The bottom panel shows a power map calculated
by adding the square of the acoustic power of a series
of artificial data spanning approximately 29 hours. The
sunspot can be seen south of the equator in the right-hand
half of the far side. It has been simulated by increasing the sound speed by approximately 10% over 1Mm in
depth and 25
to 40
in angular extent.
