UNDERLYING SOLAR MODEL The computational results reported in this paper were de rived using Magnetically Modified Model S (MMMS), an ad hoc modification of the well-known nonmagnetic Model S solar model of Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (1996). The sound speed is specified by c2 = max c2 0 a2 , 1 B2 10B2 c2 0 z + 0.4 B2 B2 (4) where B0 = 3 kG is a reference field strength character istic of umbrae, c0(z) is the sound speed in model S, and z is measured in Mm.

The near surface sound speed for various field strengths is depicted in Fig. 7. The equipartion depth as a function of B is graphed in Fig. 8. (2003)
