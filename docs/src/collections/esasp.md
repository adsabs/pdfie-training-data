# The ESA Special Publications Collection

We're interested in this collection because the data are provided as PDF files
without structured reference information.

As always, see also the file `pidata/esasp/README.md`.


## Identification

Items within this collection are grouped by volume, and named by their final
bibcode, e.g. `0624/2006ESASP.624E.121B`.


## Ingestion

The script `index.py` in the repo directory will scan and ingest PDFs based on
which ones have `.raw` classic refstring files in the ADS filesystem.
